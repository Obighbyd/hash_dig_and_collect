# Ruby Hash#dig_and_collect

The introduction of the Hash#dig  method in Ruby 2.3 completely changed the way I navigate deeply nested hashes. 

Inspired by Hash#dig this repo contains an implementation of Hash#dig_and_collect, a new utility method to navigate even more complex nested hashes without messing up your code. 
See the details of the why in this [Blog post](http://www.alfredo.motta.name/making-ruby-hashdig-even-more-awesome-introducing-hashdig_and_collect).
